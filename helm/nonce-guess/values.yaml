persistence:
  enabled: false
  ## Configure persistent storage for nonce_guess data.
  ## `storageClassName`: Specifies the storage class to use for the volume.
  ## If defined, the volume will use the specified storage class.
  ## If set to "-", dynamic provisioning is disabled and the storageClassName is set to an empty string.
  ## If left undefined or set to null, the default storage class of the cluster is used. Examples of default provisioners include:
  ##   - gp2 on Amazon Web Services
  ##   - standard on Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service, and OpenStack
  # storageClass: "-"
  ##
  ## To reuse an existing Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), specify its name with `existingClaim`.
  ## If set, the StatefulSet will use the named PVC instead of creating a new one.
  # existingClaim: "your-existing-claim"
  ##
  ## To use a host path instead of a PVC, specify the path on the host machine.
  ## This option mounts a specified path inside the host to the pod. Use with caution as it ties your pod to specific nodes.
  # hostPath: "/path/to/the/config/folder"
  ## `accessModes`: Defines the access modes for the volume. Typical modes include:
  ##   - ReadWriteOnce: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
  ##   - ReadOnlyMany: Multiple nodes can mount the volume as read-only
  ##   - ReadWriteMany: Multiple nodes can mount the volume as read-write
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  ## `size`: Defines the size of the storage volume.
  ## Specify the size of the volume. Note that resizing an existing volume is not supported in all storage classes.
